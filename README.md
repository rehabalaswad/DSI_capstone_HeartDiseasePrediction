# DSI_capstone_HeartDiseasePrediction
## **Summary**
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart attacks and strokes, are the number-one cause of deaths globally
Diagnosis tends to be driven by an initial survey of these common risk factors followed by bloodwork and other tests.
im using random forest, logiestic regresstion Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

## **The data set**
This dataset contains  survey responses from cleaned BRFSS to be used binary classification of heart disease. 
The question to be explored is:
To what extend can survey responses from the BRFSS be used for predicting heart disease risk?
Can a subset of questions from the BRFSS be used for preventative health screening for diseases like heart disease?

**The features**

Research in the field has identified the following as **important risk factors** for heart
